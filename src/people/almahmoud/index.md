# Alexandru Mahmoud

I joined the Galaxy Team in June 2018 when I started working in [James Taylor's Lab](http://taylorlab.org/) at Johns Hopkins University. The focus of my current work is in the area of cloud computing, and have particularly been concentrating on integrating Azure into our multi-cloud infrastructure.

I was first introduced to Galaxy through the [LAPPSGrid project](http://www.lappsgrid.org/) during my undergraduate years at Vassar College where I worked as a Research Assistant with Prof. Nancy Ide.
